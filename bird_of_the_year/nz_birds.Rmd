```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### loading packages 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(votesys)
```

### loading the data from the Tidy Tuesday Github repo

```{r}
nz_bird <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-11-19/nz_bird.csv")
```

This is the NewZeland Bird of the year voting contest. we will try to analyze and find out who is the winner, and why? 
*probably more stuff to figure later*

### How many breeds do we  have?

```{r}
nz_bird %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T)

nz_bird %>% 
  count(bird_breed, sort = T) %>% nrow()
```

### How is the voting is distributed over hours?

```{r}
nz_bird %>% 
  count(hour, sort = T)

nz_bird %>% 
  count(hour, sort = T) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "distribution of the voting hours")
```

### What is the range of the voing period(in days)?

```{r}
nz_bird %>% 
  count(date, sort = T) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date , y = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "distribution of the number of votes over the voting period",
       subtitle = "from the 28th of October to the 10th of November 2019")
```

This means that:
    * we have 86 breeds of birds to be voted for
    * we have 14 days for voting.
    * the peak of the votes was on the 6th of October
    * the minimum of votes was on November the 3rd
    * most of the votes was on 14:00
    * the least votes was on 03:00 

## Objective 
We need to develop a program that reads this data set and do the calculations for each round in order to rank the birds according to the given votes.
To do this we need first to understand how does the IRV system works.

#### **Instatnt runoff voting system:**

1/ A voter ranks the candidates in order of preference

2/ The votes are assigned to the top ranked bird on each ballot

3/ The bird with the fewest votes is eliminated and those votes are transferred to their second choices

4/ This process is repeated until a candidate has a majority or only two candidates remain

```{r}
nz_bird %>% 
  filter(vote_rank == "vote_1") %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T) 

nz_bird %>% 
  filter(vote_rank == "vote_2") %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T)

nz_bird %>% 
  filter(vote_rank == "vote_3") %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T)

nz_bird %>% 
  filter(vote_rank == "vote_4") %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T)

nz_bird %>% 
  filter(vote_rank == "vote_5") %>%
  count(bird_breed, sort = T)
```

After some thinking I do not think this is the tidy version of this data.
We need 5 columns indicating the rank choice of each breed, which gives us one observation (vote) per row.

We do not really have NAs in our dataset, the NAs presented are because Voters do not have to give full ranked lists.

After 3 hours of trying to figure how to spread the data using tidyr, I gave up and went back to the main repo to find out that the author used a developer function in tidyr "pivot_longer" to make it into this shape, and while I couldn't install that version of the tidyr to use the opposit function "tidy_wider", I just realized that I can just load the non modified original data, form the same repo. DEPRESSIVE.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-11-19/BOTY-votes-2019.csv") %>% select(-country)

```

NOW THIS IS THE DATA I WANT.

Let's Investigate more.
We have 43460 vote (that is a list of ranked 5 birds), this means that to have a winning bird, it needs to have 21730 votes.

```{r}
rank_bird <- nz_bird %>%
  count(bird_breed, vote_rank, sort = T) %>%
  spread(vote_rank, n) %>%
  mutate(t_votes = rowSums(nz_bird %>%
                                  count(bird_breed, vote_rank, sort = T) %>%
                                  spread(vote_rank, n) %>% 
                                  select(-bird_breed), na.rm = F )) %>%
  mutate(percentage = t_votes*100/43460) %>% 
  arrange(desc(t_votes)) 

rank_bird
```

The most voted for bird do not have a majority, therefore we need a new round of computation.
It is also important to note that the NAs which represent almost 27% of the gven votes are exhausted (eliminated)

#### *Using "votesys"*

I am going to use the votesys library which is specialized in voting systems.
and appearantly we have a winner after 79 rounds.

The irv_method function, recieves a vote object, so the first thing to do is to prepare our votig data to get there.

#### Creating a names vector of candidate birds to pass to the function creat_vote which match names and votes and create a condorcet matrix (I studied condorcet's theory in undergrad in microeconomics XD).

```{r}
library(votesys)
# create a vector of candidates names (+ NAs do not count)
n_birds <- nz_bird %>% 
  count(bird_breed) %>% 
  pull(bird_breed) %>%
  .[-1]

n_birds
```

Now we pass the names to the create_vote function to induce it to the irv_method function to get to know the coolest of birds.

```{r}
# creating a data frame of only the votes for the candidates to induce it into
# a condorcet matrix with create_vote
# the IRV calculation function(which is slow)
# I will call this iteration : cool_bird
cool_bird <- data %>% 
  select(-date, -hour) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  create_vote(., candidate = n_birds) %>%
  irv_method(.)
```

To resume the voting process we need some informations which are given in the ouput of the function.
It would be nice to Know:

    * The coolest of birds(obviously) and the vice cool bird.
    * The number of rounds to get the winning bird a majority.
    * The number of votes for both 

```{r}
n_rounds <- cool_bird$other_info %>% length()

final_birds <- cool_bird$other_info[n_rounds] %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename(birdy = Var1, n_votes = Freq) %>%
  mutate(n_rounds = n_rounds,
         abolute = cool_bird$absolute,
         winner = c(FALSE, TRUE))
final_birds
```

There You have it folks, loud and clear, we have a winner, with yellow eyes.
